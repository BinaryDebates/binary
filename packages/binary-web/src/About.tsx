As such, funds donated through Binary are legally considered gifts and are thus not tax deductible. Binary charges a 5% transaction fee in order to pay for payment processor and operational fees.</p>

        <h1>How long do fundraisers last?</h1>

        <h1>Are donations refundable?</h1>
        <p className={styles.aboutText}>While you have to provide your payment information when you make a pledge, you will only be charged if the debate happens. However, once you are charged, your donation is not refundable.</p>
